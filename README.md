# React 101 Workshop

## Introduction

Welcome to the React 101 Workshop! This workshop provides college students with a systematic approach to learning modern JavaScript development, culminating in React mastery.

Our philosophy emphasizes building a strong foundation before diving into React frameworks. This ensures you'll have a comprehensive understanding of the core concepts and tools that power modern web development.

## Why This Approach?

While React is a powerful library, it builds upon many fundamental concepts. Instead of overwhelming you with React's complexity immediately, we break down the learning journey into digestible steps. This methodical approach helps you:
