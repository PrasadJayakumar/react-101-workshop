## DOM Interaction Exploration

This exercise contrasts DOM construction via markup and scripting, and highlights the distinction between live DOM and static source.

**Goals:**

* **Markup-Driven DOM:** Establish an initial DOM structure using HTML.
* **Scripted DOM Alterations:** Modify the DOM dynamically with JavaScript.
* **Inspected DOM vs. Source:** Illustrate how the browser's inspection tool reveals the live DOM, which reflects changes made by scripts, unlike the static HTML source.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Initial HTML Setup:** Populate `index.html` with base DOM elements using standard HTML.
2.  **Dynamic JavaScript Changes:** Employ `main.js` to perform DOM modifications.
3.  **Browser Inspection Analysis:** Examine the rendered page using the browser's developer tools, noting differences between the displayed DOM and the original HTML.
